Use python's own functions, time and sys. You don't need any upload but you need 1 upload function. It's the name of plyer so if you want to console or and IDE, you can write the pip install plyer that's all.
Thanks to sys, we can do the counting in a single line.
In addition, I wrote another code inside the while loop to ensure that notifications are also displayed on the desktop. We do this using the plyer function. You can change the duration of the notification from the code I prepared.
